## Compositional Abstractions Tutorial (Personal Copy)

This repository is a personal working copy of the original project [`cogtoolslab/compositional-abstractions-tutorial`](https://github.com/cogtoolslab/compositional-abstractions-tutorial).

For the original documentation, please see [`README_original.md`](./README_original.md) in this repository.

`notebooks_new/4_transmission_chain_sim.ipynb` and `5_pid_synergy_demo.ipynb` contain exploratory extensions on transmission-chain simulations and a small PID-style synergy demo that build on the original three tutorials.

This readme is still under construction.
