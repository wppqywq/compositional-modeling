We wanted to know how participants might have 'chunked' blocks together into larger abstractions as they proceeded through the twelve trials of the task. We worked through a model of abstraction as library learning, where people build up a collection of program fragments corresponding to possible concepts (literally 'building blocks', if you like). For each trial, we could then use the current library to propose possible programs that express the scene in different ways. \n",

    "In a probabilistic framework, learning is equivalent to updating one's beliefs given new observations. We thus need to extend our `FixedAgent` class from Section 2 with a `update_beliefs()` function, using Bayes' rule to turn their prior into a posterior, $P(\\mathcal{L} | o)$, using the outcomes `o` on the previous trials. Here's Bayes' rule, which gives us a blueprint to handle this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(\\mathcal{L} | o) = \\frac{P(o | \\mathcal{L})P(\\mathcal{L})}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{L}} P(o | \\mathcal{L}) P(\\mathcal{L})}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We already have the prior term $P(\\mathcal{L})$, but we're missing the likelihood term $P(o | \\mathcal{L})$ which scores how likely a given utterance or action on the previous trials would be under different lexicons $\\mathcal{L}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Following Hawkins et al. (2023), we use a likelihood where each agent reasons about a (simplified) mental model of the other agent, and asks how likely the other agent would be to make a given choice if they had a given lexicon in their head. Specifically, the architect tries to design utterances to maximize the probability of success assuming a literal builder $B_0(a | u)$, which chooses among actions $a$ that are literally consistent with the utterance $u$ they hear. Meanwhile, the builder tries to pick actions assuming the architect $A_0(u | a^*)$ is choosing utterances $u$ that are literally consistent with the target step $a^*$ they are trying to convey."

    "In principle, words allow us to communicate arbitrarily complex concepts, and our mental representation of linguistic meaning is flexible enough to be updated over time. To the extent that both Architects and Builders are learning to 'chunk' blocks over time, each  program fragment) could, in principle, be assigned a new word or phrase, and conveyed directly through the Architects' instructions. Well, almost. There is no guarantee that the words the Architect chooses to pick out a new concept would invoke the same concept in someone else. There is actually uncertainty about how the Builder will interpret the Architects' instructions and this, we suggest, might change what the Architect chooses to say.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our hypothesis is that Architects trade-off communicative *efficiency* with communicative *effectiveness*. While they generally want to say things concisely, if there is too much uncertainty about how the Builder will interpret their words, they will choose a less ambiguous (if more verbose) way of expressing the same information. Concretely, if the Architect wanted to say \"build an L\" but they thought that the Builder wouldn't get what \"L\" meant, they might spell out the steps to make an L-shaped tower instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wow, this is great! We can see our agents are updating their beliefs about the lexicon over time and able to get somewhat more accurate as they coordinate. But one of the most interesting things about our empirical data is that speakers seem to be strategically choosing which representation of the tower to convey -- our hypothesis is that the reason participants reduce the length of their utterances over time is that even when new library chunks come online, architects don't always try to refer to them right away. They aren't confident enough that their partner will understand, as the block-level descriptions are much safer. However, the block-level descriptions are also much *costlier* in terms of time and effect because they have to laboriously describe one action at a time. \n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we just used a placeholder for how the speaker picks which representation to communication: they just randomly pick from the list of candidates, slightly preferring shorter programs. However, there are other considerations that ought to go into this decision, namely the estimated likelihood that the listener will do the right thing."
